# ResuMate_Resume_Evaulation_Tool
ResuMate is a project to create a technology-based solution that provides personalized feedback and guidance to job seekers, helping them to improve their resumes and increase their chances of being selected for an interview. In today’s era, a lot of students fill in their resumes with irrelevant skills and skills which aren’t in the trend. Practically, when companies review the applicant’s resume, they reject all the poor resumes giving no feedback or suggestions to the applicants. So we have come up with this idea, that will assist students in knowing whether their resumes are appropriate for their desired jobs. Also, as the project is student-oriented, if a student is in the confusion about selecting a job profile for himself, our software can also assist in suggesting convenient job profiles by reviewing his resume.

In today’s fast-moving world, the recruitment process for a job is no non-sense and quick. Your resume becomes a make-or-break deal for getting the job. We, as a team, share a common confusion about ways to build the quality of our resume- what skills to include, whether hackathon participation mentions are necessary, how long should the skill descriptions be, etc. When we surfed the internet for resolving our issue, surprisingly, there were very few convenient resume-building tools. So, we took the responsibility of solving our own problems.
